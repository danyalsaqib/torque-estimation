link 1 has descriptions of xacros, that can get me real-time URDF descriptions of the robot.

link 2 is the link to the library, pinocchio, which builds on top of rbdl to provide efficient rigid-body algorithms. Seems to be much better than rbdl, because it does handle rotation of body frames as well.

The next steps are as follows:

a)
1. Make a new ROS node, that subscribes to the /joint_states topic
2. Perform differences, generate joint velocities and accelerations
3. Publish to new ROS Topic /joint_vel_acc

b)
1. Make a new ROS node, that subscribes to the /joint_states and /joint_vel_acc topics
2. Perform inverse dynamics computations using the pinocchio library, and obtain torque estimations
3. Publish to new ROS Topic /torque_estimation
